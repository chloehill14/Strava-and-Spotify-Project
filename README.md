This is a project to explore my personal running history.
It started in Jan 2024 and has slowly built up.


The contents:
-------------

Strava:
- Use the Strava API to get access to my running data and then clean it up.

Spotify:
- Clean up my Spotify listening data from my Extended Listening History.

Strava and Spotify:
- Join the listening data to the Strava activities.


I visualise the data using Tableau:
